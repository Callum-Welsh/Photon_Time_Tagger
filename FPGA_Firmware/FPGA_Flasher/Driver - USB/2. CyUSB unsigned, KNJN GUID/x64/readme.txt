The driver is not signed so you need to disable Window's driver signing enforcement.

For just one session, use this:
1. At the beginning of Windows boot, press F8
2. Choose "Disable Driver Signature Enforcement".
3. Once Windows is booted, plug your KNJN FPGA board into a USB port and install the driver.

For multiple sessions, you can sign locally the driver and use Windows in test mode.
